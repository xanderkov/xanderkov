My name is **Alexander Kovel**. Currently I'm a software engineer student at BMSTU. I am interested in machine and deep learning research.



### :computer: List of technologies

My main programming language is Python 3, because it is very useful and comfortable for performing machine learning experiments. I am familiar both with classical methods (linear regression, gradient boosting e.g.) and deep learning models. I use Google Colab.

You can see set of mostly used technologies and libraries below:
